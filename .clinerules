- Identified code roots: src, tests, utils.
- Updated project documentation with comprehensive requirements.
- Created detailed strategic plan for Phase 1 (CMS with file management).
- Created implementation instructions for all major Phase 1 components.
- Transitioned to Execution phase to implement Syslog server component.
- Implemented Syslog server with log categorization and web viewer.
- Used balabit/syslog-ng for the syslog server and amir20/dozzle for the log viewer.

- Fixed Docker infrastructure logging configuration by changing container logging driver from syslog to json-file.
- Removed non-existent python-logging-handler package from requirements.txt.
- Removed unnecessary logshipper container since logs are now managed via json-file driver.
- Configured syslog-ng to forward logs to Graylog in GELF format with proper host field.
- Exposed GELF UDP port (12201) in Graylog container to receive logs directly.
- Converted syslog test script from Bash to Python for better compatibility with project environment.
- Implemented Python logging facility with syslog integration for standardized application logging.
- Created example Django views demonstrating proper logging with different log levels.
- Fixed TCP logging by implementing a custom TCP handler for reliable syslog communication.
- Created detailed Django implementation plan for CMS with file management supporting files up to 5GB.
- Implemented file metadata editing functionality allowing users to update file details after upload.
- Fixed file upload functionality to reliably handle files up to 5GB in size.
- Created user-friendly file detail page with download, edit, and delete capabilities.

- Created password change functionality with enhanced security features.
- Added user activity tracking to display documents and files created by the user.
- Implemented responsive UI for profile management with dark mode support.
- Fixed circular import issue in CMS document forms by directly defining form classes in forms/__init__.py module.
- Fixed URL name mismatch for user profile in base.html template.
- Fixed TinyMCE editor read-only mode issue by modifying editor-switcher.js to set global TinyMCE settings with readonly:false and verify editor mode after initialization.
- Eliminated TinyMCE API key warning by implementing a comprehensive configuration module with proper self-hosted mode setup and notification suppression.
- Improved TinyMCE self-hosted mode configuration by creating tinymce-init.js that pre-configures TinyMCE before it loads to prevent API key validation.
- Fixed TinyMCE editor initialization issues by implementing a robust approach with tinymce-core.js that provides proper path detection, warning suppression, and error handling for reliable editor loading.
- Fixed TinyMCE resource loading with explicit path mappings for plugins, themes, models, and skins to ensure all editor components load correctly.
- Completely rewrote TinyMCE initialization with hardcoded paths, multi-level read-only prevention, and enhanced error handling to fix persistent loading issues.
