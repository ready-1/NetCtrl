[LEARNING_JOURNAL]
- Initial setup completed on April 7, 2025.
- Identified code roots: src, tests, utils.
- Updated project documentation with comprehensive requirements.
- Created detailed strategic plan for Phase 1 (CMS with file management).
- Created implementation instructions for all major Phase 1 components.
- Transitioned to Execution phase to implement Syslog server component.

- Used balabit/syslog-ng for the syslog server and amir20/dozzle for the log viewer.
- Created Docker Compose configuration for centralized logging.
- Set up log rotation with categorization by service.
- Changed log viewer from Dozzle to Graylog for improved log viewing capabilities.
- Fixed Docker infrastructure logging configuration by changing container logging driver from syslog to json-file.
- Removed non-existent python-logging-handler package from requirements.txt.
- Removed unnecessary logshipper container since logs are now managed via json-file driver.
- Configured syslog-ng to forward logs to Graylog in GELF format with proper host field.
- Exposed GELF UDP port (12201) in Graylog container to receive logs directly.
- Converted syslog test script from Bash to Python for better compatibility with project environment.
- Implemented Python logging facility with syslog integration for standardized application logging.
- Created example Django views demonstrating proper logging with different log levels.
- Fixed TCP logging by implementing a custom TCP handler for reliable syslog communication.
