# Deployment Preparation Instructions

## Objective
Prepare the NetCtrl application for deployment in an air-gapped Debian environment, ensuring all components function correctly without internet access.

## Context
This task involves creating a deployment package that can be transferred to and installed on an air-gapped Debian server. All dependencies, configuration files, and documentation must be included in the package.

## Dependencies
- All implementation tasks complete
- Testing complete

## Steps

1. **Create Production Configuration**
   - Finalize `compose.yaml` for production
   - Update Nginx configuration for production
   - Finalize Django settings for production
   - Create environment variable templates

2. **Prepare Static Assets**
   - Collect and package all static files
   - Include Bootstrap 5.3 and other frontend libraries
   - Optimize images and other assets
   - Create `collectstatic` script

3. **Package Database Initialization**
   - Create database initialization scripts
   - Include initial data fixtures
   - Document database migration process
   - Test database setup process

4. **Prepare Docker Images**
   - Build final Docker images for all services
   - Save images using `docker save`
   - Document image loading process
   - Verify image integrity

5. **Create Deployment Scripts**
   - Write installation script for Debian
   - Create database initialization script
   - Write service startup script
   - Add backup/restore utilities

6. **Create Air-Gapped Documentation**
   - Document offline installation process
   - Create troubleshooting guide
   - Add system requirements documentation
   - Include architecture diagrams

7. **Test Deployment Process**
   - Set up isolated test environment
   - Test deployment from package
   - Verify all services start correctly
   - Test without internet connectivity

8. **Create Administrator Documentation**
   - Write system administration guide
   - Document common maintenance tasks
   - Create backup and restore procedures
   - Add security hardening recommendations

9. **Package All Components**
   - Combine all code, configuration, and Docker images
   - Create directory structure matching target environment
   - Generate manifest of all included files
   - Create checksums for verification

10. **Create User Documentation**
    - Write user manual for CMS
    - Document file management procedures
    - Create quick start guide
    - Add frequently asked questions

## Expected Output
- Complete deployment package for air-gapped environment
- Installation and configuration documentation
- Administrator and user guides
- Deployment verification procedures
- Backup and restore utilities

## Notes
- Remember that the target environment has no internet access
- Include all dependencies in the package
- Document all assumptions about the target environment
- Test the deployment process thoroughly
- Consider creating a VM-based test environment that mimics the target
- Verify that all services can start without internet connectivity
- Ensure security best practices are followed

## Mini Dependency Tracker
- Depends on: All implementation tasks, Testing
- Final output for Phase 1
