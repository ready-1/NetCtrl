# CMS Core Implementation Instructions

## Objective
Implement the core Content Management System (CMS) functionality for the NetCtrl application, including document creation, editing, viewing, and user management.

## Context
This task builds upon the Django project structure to implement the content management capabilities required for Phase 1. It focuses on the Document model and associated CRUD operations, along with the user interface for content management.

## Dependencies

   - Ensure mobile-first responsive design
   - Implement dark mode compatible styling

5. **Add Rich Text Editor**

## Expected Output
- Fully functional Document model with CRUD operations
- Complete set of templates for document management
- Working rich text editor for content creation
- User dashboard and management interfaces
- Search and filtering functionality
- Mobile-responsive and dark mode compatible interface
